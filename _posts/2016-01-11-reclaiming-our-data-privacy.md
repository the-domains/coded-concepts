# RECLAIMING OUR DATA PRIVACY ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f66880a7-c836-4ba6-8cd0-8d2a9ef8dd5f.jpg)

THIS WEEK MARKED the sixth annual Data Privacy Day, led by the National Cyber Security Alliance. It marked the signing of an international treaty addressing data protection and privacy. It's a terrific idea -- encouraging Internet users to spend some time thinking about and researching our online privacy. 

The trouble is, we don't have much privacy left in the digital realm. The day might be better named "Reclaim Data Privacy Day."

For example, plenty of consumers happily sign away their privacy in exchange for convenience and they don't even know they're doing it. Collecting and selling information about what you do online is big business. 

Take Facebook. It's no secret the company is tracking your behavior, collecting the information you share. An October Forbes article gave us all a glimpse into how companies use Facebook behavioral information as Japanese cataloguer Nissen bragged about its successes mining personal data to increase sales. 

Facebook Connect -- the service that allows you to log into multiple sites using Facebook credentials -- offers great convenience. But depending on your privacy settings, the cost of that one-click entry could be steep, from your entire list of friends to all your likes and posts. But people are getting smarter. A recent eMarketer study tells us that nearly half of all US Internet users have never used a social log-in service. The biggest reason why? Concerns over privacy. 

These same companies that track you also claim to offer trust. It's ironic that the trust-based companies, in deference to user privacy, know not to go into advertising. So why is it that some online advertisers think they can deliver trust? 

How would you feel if your anti-virus provider exploited its position in your desktop or mobile device to target advertising to you on your next browser search? Why aren't we as outraged when it happens the other way? I think the end game for user privacy is a separation of selling advertising from providing trust. 

However, I applaud the notion behind Data Privacy Day. People should reclaim their privacy online and take control over their digital identities, which right now are under attack. 

Our digital identity is the uniquely personal information that validates who we are online. Currently, we're spread all over the web and Cyber criminals pluck bits and pieces to get at the whole and companies brag about how they're making money doing the same thing. 

We'll have personal privacy online when we take control of our digital identities. Until now, consumers haven't had any real options for protecting themselves online. It was either share your information or become a Luddite. Today there are choices to taking back your digital identity. It's a long road to truly owning your digital footprint, but every step counts.
